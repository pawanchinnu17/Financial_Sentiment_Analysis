Financial sentiment analysis is crucial for understanding market emotions and making informed investment decisions. This project analyzes financial text data to determine the sentiment expressed, which can be valuable for:

- **Investment Strategy**: Understanding market sentiment to guide investment decisions
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying negative sentiment trends that might indicate potential risks
- **Market Research**: Analyzing public opinion about financial instruments or companies
- **Automated Trading**: Incorporating sentiment scores into algorithmic trading strategies

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multiple ML Models**: Implementation of various algorithms including Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression
- **Deep Learning Models**: Advanced neural networks including RNN and LSTM for improved accuracy
- **Text Preprocessing**: Comprehensive text cleaning with NLTK including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop word removal
- **Data Visualization**: Clear charts and graphs showing sentiment distribution and model performance
- **Model Comparison**: Performance evaluation across different algorithms to find the best approach
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves ~87% test accuracy with LSTM model
